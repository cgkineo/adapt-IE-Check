adapt-IE-Check
=================

An extension to raise an alert if Internet Explorer is not behaving itself.

An alert will be raised if:
* The version of IE being used is less than the minimum supported version (defaults to 8)
* Compatibility view is switched on
* Some form of compatibility mode is active (i.e. the 'document mode' is less than the actual version)

Mainly used in the Adapt Scorm Test but could be used in any course where there's a risk of IE doing one of the above.
